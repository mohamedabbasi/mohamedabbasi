Hello, my name is Mohamed Abbasi and I'm a second-year undergraduate student at Carleton University majoring in Computer Science.
I love creating, designing and developing that's why I chose to study CS. My area of interest right now is Full Stack development!
Learning more about computer science in my first-year in university made me feel destined and prepared to expand my knowledge through building projects and sharing it with the world!
